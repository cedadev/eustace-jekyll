The first paragraph of the blog post is really important. It is shown on the home page
alongside the title and should give browsing users enough information about the article
to know whether they want to read it or not. It should be short and give an over view 
of what you are going to talk about.

# Background

It might be useful to give your readers some context to the project you are describing.
If this is a follow up article based on a previous one, you could link to your [older post]({% post_url 2021-07-05-search-futures %}).
You could also link to external articles as well, if they provide sufficent background.

# The middle bit

This is where you discuss your project. You could separate the subject into several smaller
areas. If you create more headings, you could add them to the index so people can jump to them.

Be mindful of your audience and try to lay things out clearly. [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) is a good tool
to put your text through to check for grammar and tone.

It is also nice to add images in this section.
