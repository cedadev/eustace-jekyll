EUSTACE users: why specific pages?
This part of the web site is for potential users of the final EUSTACE products. Results produced by scientific projects often arenâ€™t directly in the format that can be used by others. Processing or translation is needed for many (potential) users, generally. This is also true for the information provided about a project on a website: potential users are experts in their own field of work, but they may have limited knowledge of climate data.
