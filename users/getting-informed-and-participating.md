<h2><strong>Ways we involved potential users</strong></h2>
<p>Results produced by scientific projects often arenâ€™t directly in the format that can be used by others. Processing or translation is needed generally, for many (potential) users. To increase the usability of the EUSTACE products, we involved potential users from the early start in different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>We asked for user requirements and experiences with other temperature data sets in <strong><a href="/users/getting-informed-and-participating/user-consultation-meetings/"><em>user workshops and questionnaires</em></a></strong>;</li>
<li>We asked the trail blazer users for feedback on example or preliminary datafiles and on specific aspects related to the final products (e.g. provide all uncertainty info in one file? How to provide the temperature estimates for land, ice and oceans?);</li>
<li>Together with potential users we described <a href="https://www.eustaceproject.eu/users/use-if-temperature-data/"><strong><em>potential use cases</em></strong></a> with advantages and limitations of the EUSTACE datasets</li>
<li>Potential users gave presentations on use cases during <a href="/users/getting-informed-and-participating/user-consultation-meetings/"><em><strong>workshops</strong></em></a>, and potential users participated in discussions on the design and development of the EUSTACE data sets and supporting material.</li>
</ul>
