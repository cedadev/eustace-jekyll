<p>In 2016, 2017 and 2018 user consultation meetings were organized to inform potential users about EUSTACE progress, to show preliminary products and to collect feedback on the format and usability of the preliminary products. The meeting in 2018 was focussed more on informing potential users.</p>
<p>During the first part of 2015 several user consultation meetings were held too. Potential users were informed about the project and information on user requirements was collected. This information was used for determining the design requirementsÂ  (report 16 under <em><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/final-results/">Final EUSTACE results</a></em>).</p>
<p>In the menu under "user meetings" an overview of activities in the various years can be found.</p>
