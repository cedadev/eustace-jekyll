title: EUSTACE Work Packages
---

<p><strong>EUSTACE was organised into six inter-linked work packages:</strong> <br> <br><strong></strong></p>
<h2><strong>WP1: Observation integration</strong> (lead: DMI)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Integrate surface and air temperature measurements from both satellite and in situ including all surfaces i.e. land, lakes, ocean, sea ice, and ice sheets.</li>
<li>Derive relationships between surface skin temperature observations and surface air temperatures, with uncertainties, to be used together with homogenised in situ records in WP2 to construct the global temperature record over 166 years.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>WP2: Data set construction</strong> (lead: Met Office)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Design, develop, build and run a sustainable system to create a daily globally-complete near-surface air temperature data set from 1850 with consistent uncertainty information.  </li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>WP3: Validation and intercomparison</strong> (lead: University of Leicester)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Perform an independent and consistent validation and intercomparison of both the surface air temperature fields inferred from retrievals, and the final in-filled EUSTACE products for all surfaces of the Earth - land, lakes, ocean, sea ice, and ice sheets – for the period since 1850.  </li>
<li>To identify and acquire available and accessible existing digitised data holdings from other projects, and establishing access through formal links to maximise sufficient coverage of validation data for all surfaces.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>WP4: Outreach and dissemination</strong> (lead: KNMI and STFC)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Provide the interface between the project and the rest of the world. It will lead the interactions with potential user communities through various means.</li>
<li>Coordinate dissemination of information which will include written user guides, an active web site and peer-reviewed papers.</li>
<li>Document final data products with detailed metadata and the outputs themselves, to be published through established routes to enable access via a large community of users.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>WP5: Science leadership</strong> (lead: Met Office)</h2>
<ul>
<li>To establish and maintain the scientific coordination in order to meet the scientific objectives of the project;</li>
<li>Ensure the appropriate level of consultation with the advisory board of independent experts is established and maintained.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>WP6: Project management</strong> (lead: Met Office)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Provide top level management of the project to ensure aims of the project are efficiently and effectively met, on time and with the resources budgeted;</li>
<li>Provide effective reporting and communication between the consortium and the European Commission;</li>
<li>Coordinate and facilitate effective communication between partners within the project; including information associated with all project management aspects.</li>
