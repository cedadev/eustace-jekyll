<h2><strong>Objective:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Design, develop, build and run a sustainable system to create a daily globally-complete near-surface air temperature data set from 1850 with consistent uncertainty information.  </li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Tasks:</strong></h2>
<p>T2.1 Product Design <br>T2.2 Creation of consistent air temperature fields from satellite and in situ data <br>T2.3 Analysis and in filling methods: novel statistical methods will be developed <br>T2.4 System Development <br>T2.5 Product generation and verification</p>
<h2><strong>Description:</strong></h2>
<p>EUSTACE utilized a wealth of surface and air temperature measurements from both satellite and <em>in situ</em> measurement platforms for all surfaces - land, lakes, ocean, sea ice, and ice sheets. By the end of the project, these individual strands were combined in a consistent way to build a globally complete near-surface temperature record over 166 years with uncertainty information. WP2 took recommendations for producing air temperature estimates over different surfaces from WP1 and combined these using a state-of-the-art statistical system to create a globally-complete daily analysis. The data processing challenges were met using big-data techniques and novel statistical methods. The inputs, processing and infilling were combined in a single system designed to be sustainable and to provide products tailored to well defined user needs obtained from WP4.</p>
