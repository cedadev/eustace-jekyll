<h2><strong>Objectives:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Perform an independent and consistent validation and intercomparison of both the surface air temperature fields inferred from retrievals, and the final in-filled EUSTACE products for all surfaces of the Earth - land, lakes, ocean, sea ice, and ice sheets – for the period since 1850.  </li>
<li>To identify and acquire available and accessible existing digitised data holdings from other projects, and establishing access through formal links to maximise sufficient coverage of validation data for all surfaces.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Tasks:</strong></h2>
<p>T3.1 Use of recently rescued data: historical and research campaign data for validation <br>T3.2 Comparison to other surface temperature data sets, reanalysis <br>T3.3 Validation against reference data of analysis and uncertainties</p>
<h2><strong>Description:</strong></h2>
<p>To achieve these objectives, both comparison to other surface temperature datasets, and validation against<em> in situ</em> measurements are performed. Validation here can be defined as a direct comparison of the air temperature output product with collocated and simultaneously acquired air temperature measurements from independent meteorological station instruments; intercomparison on the other hand involves a direct comparison of the air temperature output product with alternative air temperature products. To maximise sufficiently coverage of validation data for different surfaces over the time period a data gathering and rescue effort is required. This primarily entails identifying availability and accessibility to existing digitised data holdings from other projects, and establishing access through formal links where required. The strategy used across all tasks within this Work Package is to follow a consistent approach, as opposed to disparate individual efforts, with the validation and intercomparison work adhering to standardised protocols. It is also important to maintain an independence from the dataset production, whereby the following interactions were foreseen with other work packages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inclusion of matchups in a Matchup DataBase (MDB) developed for EUSTACE for explicit development of relationships in WP1</li>
<li>Feedback from evaluation of intermediate fields to WP1</li>
<li>Input of blended data from WP2, and subsequent feedback from evaluation of these data to WP2 as part of an iterative “evaluation loop”</li>
</ul>
