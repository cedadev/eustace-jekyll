<p>DMI provides meteorological, oceanographic and climate related services for the community within the large geographical area of the Kingdom of Denmark (Denmark, Faroe Island and Greenland), including surrounding waters and airspace. The area of activity comprises forecasting and warning services, continuous monitoring of weather, sea state, climate, and related environmental conditions in the atmosphere, over land and in the sea. The purpose of DMI is to assist in the protection of life and property, as well as to provide a basis for economic and environmental planning (aviation, national defence, shipping, agriculture, sporting and recreational events, etc.). DMI is responsible for the operational monitoring of sea ice, operational support for ship traffic for safe navigation, storm surge warnings, wave forecasts, sea ice drift forecasts and other operational oceanographic products.</p>
<p>Through the DMI Centre for Ocean and Ice, the Arctic and Greenland in particular is a special focus region for both the operational, research and development activities at DMI. For example, DMI has a central role in EUMETSAT’s ocean and sea ice satellite application facility and in ESA’s climate change initiative on sea ice, both projects dealing with the remote sensing of sea ice.</p>

<p>DMI leads Work Package 1 on Observation Integration and provided expertise on the estimation of air temperature from ice surface skin temperature retrievals.</p>
