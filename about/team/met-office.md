<p><span>The Met Office was founded in 1854 and has provided the UK’s National Meteorological Service (NMS) since then. This makes the Met Office uniquely positioned to provide meteorological observational data going back to the 1850’s. Throughout its long history, the Met Office has been at the forefront of meteorological scientific advance and in the last few decades has become one of the recognised world leading organisations in the field of climate science through its Met Office Hadley Centre.</span></p><p><br/>As a leading organisation in the European Meteorological Satellite programme we are constantly improving the way we use established satellite observations for weather and climate applications, and preparing for the use of new measurements from space. We are engaged in the assimilation of a wide range of satellite data into NWP models, the development of new imagery products for forecasting, climate and environmental applications. We take a leading role in the EUMETSAT NWP Satellite Application Facility and provide advice to the space agencies.</p><p><br/>Throughout its history, the Met Office has demonstrated its drive to provide outreach and dissemination across all levels. This is clearly evidenced from our public facing weather forecasts, to the organisation and delivery of workshops and conferences for the scientific research community, and from the publication of scientific papers in leading science journals to briefings and papers for policy makers.</p><p><br/>The Met Office Hadley Centre has been developing Climate Data Records for over 20 years. Its personnel are skilled in the development of systems for the production and robust continuation of these data sets.  It leads the ESA CCI Climate Modelling User Group and so is skilled at providing an interface between users and Earth Observations (EO) data.</p><p></p><p>The Met Office was the EUSTACE coordinator, leader of WP2 on Data Set Construction and also provided expertise on the estimation of surface air temperature from skin temperature retrievals and on development of systems for the production of complete fields of air temperature.</p><ul class="portfolio-items col-3"></ul>
